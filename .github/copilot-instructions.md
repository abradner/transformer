# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Context
- **Tech Stack**: Ruby on Rails 8.0.2 + React (JS/TS), modern asset pipeline
- **Development Approach**: BDD with RSpec/Jest, DRY functional code, library usage
- **Documentation**: Maintain README + goals.md (project tracker), include Mermaid diagrams

## Workflow Pattern
1. Update `goals.md` with intended action
2. Write tests (RSpec/Jest) for expected functionality  
3. Implement well-factored code using appropriate libraries
4. Update `goals.md` with outcome
5. Update README/documentation

## Code Quality Standards
- **Rails**: Expert-level modern practices, leverage Rails 8 features
- **React**: Provide guidance for JS/TS, evaluate design decisions critically
- **Testing**: BDD approach, comprehensive test coverage
- **Architecture**: DRY, functional, well-factored with common libraries

## Documentation Requirements
- **goals.md**: Jira-style tracker with Epics → Stories → Tasks, maintain history
- **README.md**: Clear structure, current state, Mermaid diagrams for flows
- Keep all docs synchronized and up-to-date

## Collaboration Style
- Provide expert guidance and critical evaluation
- Don't assume human suggestions are correct (especially React)
- Leverage extensive Rails experience, strengthen React knowledge
- Focus on modern best practices and maintainable architecture
