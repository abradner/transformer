## Architecture Decisions

### Transformation Engine Design
- **Modular**: Each transformation type as separate module
- **Interface-based**: Common contract for all transformations
- **Composable**: Chain multiple transformations
- **CLI-ready**: Logic separated from web interface

### Data Flow
```
Input ‚Üí Transformation Selection ‚Üí Processing Engine ‚Üí Output
                ‚Üì
        Named Storage ‚Üê ‚Üí Built-in Library
```

### Component Structure (React)
- **PatternEditor**: Regex/YAML crafting with syntax highlighting
- **InputPanel**: Text input with file upload support
- **OutputPanel**: Results display with export options
- **TransformationPicker**: Browse/select saved transformations
